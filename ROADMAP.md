# UplinkWitness roadmap

UplinkWitness is intentionally developed as a small, dependable Internet-connection black box rather than a general-purpose observability platform.

The roadmap is ordered by reliability and evidence quality first, feature count second.

## Current baseline — v1.2.x

The current stable baseline provides:

- vendor-neutral Linux monitoring
- physical/link carrier detection where Linux exposes it
- gateway, Internet, DNS and HTTP probes
- source-separated public-IP and router-WAN-IP change tracking
- outage classification with in-place escalation to stronger evidence
- local SQLite history and incident bundles
- responsive dashboard and ISP-oriented reports
- optional FRITZ!Box/TR-064 telemetry for deeper WAN diagnostics
- FRITZ!Box reboot and WAN/PPPoE session-reset correlation
- best-effort FRITZ!Box CPU-temperature telemetry with 24 h history/statistics where supported

The immediate priority is to harden this baseline through real-world compatibility reports and better evidence surfaces rather than rapidly adding unrelated features.

## Near term

### 1. Broaden real-world Linux validation

Collect repeatable compatibility results across:

- Debian and Ubuntu releases
- Raspberry Pi / ARM64 and x86_64 hardware
- wired and wireless hosts
- routers that answer gateway ICMP and routers that do not

The validation procedure lives in [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) and verified results are tracked in [`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

### 2. Stabilize the router-adapter boundary

Keep vendor-specific code out of the generic monitoring core and define a small, testable contract for optional router telemetry such as:

- router identity / firmware
- router uptime
- WAN state and uptime
- WAN transport
- WAN/public IP where available
- vendor event/log context around incidents
- optional health/physical-link metrics exposed by the adapter

This should be completed before adding several router vendors.

### 3. Improve failure evidence, not just alert volume

Prioritize changes that make an incident easier to explain after the fact. Current follow-up work is tracked in [#11](https://github.com/LucaXTech/UplinkWitness/issues/11) and includes router-agnostic IPv4/IPv6/path diagnostics plus optional physical-WAN evidence where a router exposes it.

### 4. Complete the brand transition without breaking upgrades

The public project is now **UplinkWitness**. Existing runtime identifiers such as `linewatch.service`, `LINEWATCH_*` environment variables and the historical SQLite filename remain intentionally stable for compatibility. Any future internal-identifier migration should be explicit, documented and backward-compatible rather than bundled into the public rename.

## Next integrations

After the adapter contract is stable, candidate enhanced integrations include:

- OpenWrt
- MikroTik RouterOS
- UniFi gateways

A vendor is only listed as supported after a real implementation has been validated against actual hardware or a strong external compatibility report. Planned integrations are not advertised as current support.

## Packaging and portability

The automatic installer currently targets `apt` + `systemd` systems. Future portability work may include cleaner manual-install documentation and packaging/service recipes for additional Linux distributions.

Containerization is not automatically considered a win for UplinkWitness: network namespaces can hide the host link and default-route state that the monitor is specifically trying to observe. Any container deployment must preserve diagnostic fidelity.

## Non-goals

UplinkWitness is not trying to become:

- a hosted SaaS monitoring service
- a replacement for Prometheus/Grafana or full infrastructure observability
- a public Internet status page
- a router-management suite
- a cloud-dependent agent

The project should remain useful when the Internet is failing, keep its evidence local, and make unsupported claims conservatively.

## How to help

Useful contributions include compatibility reports, reproducible failure cases, tests, documentation and focused router-adapter work. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
